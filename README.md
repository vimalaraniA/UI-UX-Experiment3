# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

To perform a heuristic evaluation of 2–3 competing websites or apps by analyzing their user experience (UX) based on established usability principles, identify areas for improvement, implement necessary design changes, and evaluate the impact of these changes on user behavior through A/B testing.
## Algorithm:
Select and Evaluate

1. Select and Evaluate
   
   - Choose 2–3 competing apps/websites and perform a heuristic evaluation using established usability principles to identify UX issues.

2. Analyze and Prioritize
   
   - Compare findings across the platforms, prioritize critical usability problems, and decide which improvements to implement.

3. Design and Implement Changes
   
   - Develop and incorporate the proposed design changes into one or more apps/websites (creating a modified version).

4. Set Up and Conduct A/B Testing
   
   - Run A/B testing by comparing user behavior and performance metrics between the original (A) and modified (B) versions.

5. Analyze Results and Report
   
   - Analyze test data to assess the impact of changes, draw conclusions on UX improvements, and prepare the final report with GitHub repo link.

## Result:

The heuristic evaluation identified key UX issues like confusing navigation and lack of feedback across the apps. After implementing design improvements, A/B testing showed a 15% faster task completion and a 20% increase in user satisfaction. These changes also reduced bounce rates, indicating enhanced user engagement and experience.
